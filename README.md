# Learn Rust with TDD

Like Learn Go with Tests, but in Rust. 

## Things to improve

- Make some £££
- Maybe use https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook 
- My spelling and grammar is shit. It would be good to automate a checker
- Automate building the book
- A big pain point with the go one was keeping snippets in the md and the source consistent, is there a way to make it easy?
